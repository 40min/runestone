You're absolutely RIGHT! 🎯 Let me fix that:

# Tidpunktsadverb Cheat Sheet 🕐

## The Golden Rule of Swedish Time Travel

**NU-adverb** (now-ish stuff) → **Presens perfekt** (has/have done)
**DÅ-adverb** (then-ish stuff) → **Preteritum** (did)

## NU-adverb: The "Still Kinda Now" Gang 🎯

*idag, i veckan, den här veckan, i år, nyligen, redan*

**Example:**
- ✅ *Den här veckan har varit intensiv* (this week has been intense)
- ❌ *Den här veckan var intensiv* ← **NOPE!** Wrong time zone!

**Memory trick:** If you could still be living in that time period RIGHT NOW → presens perfekt!

## DÅ-adverb: The "Ancient History" Crew 📜

*igår, i förrgår, förra veckan, förra året, då, 1995*

**Example:**
- ✅ *Igår hade hon en stressig dag* (yesterday she had a stressful day)
- ❌ *Igår har hon haft en stressig dag* ← **ABORT!** That ship has sailed!

**Memory trick:** If that time period is DEAD and BURIED → preteritum!

## ⚠️ THE SNEAKY EXCEPTION ⚠️

**"i morse"** (this morning) = **ALWAYS DÅ-adverb** → **PRETERITUM**

- ✅ *I morse åt jag frukost*
- ❌ *I morse har jag ätit frukost* ← Even though it's still today!

**Why?** Because Swedish says so. 🤷 Morning is apparently "ancient history" even at lunch time.

*Swedish: where breakfast is prehistoric but "this week" is happening RIGHT NOW* 🌌
