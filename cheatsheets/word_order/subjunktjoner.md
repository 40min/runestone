# 🇸🇪 Subjunktjoner — The Cheat Sheet 🇸🇪
### *(Yes, Swedish has rules. No, Brian doesn't care.)*

## ⏰ Tidssubjunktjoner — "When did the thing happen?"

| Subjunktion | Meaning | Vibe |
|---|---|---|
| **innan** | before | You do the thing FIRST, then the other thing happens |
| **medan** | at the same time | Two things happening simultaneously |
| **när** | when/after | One thing finishes → the next one starts |

**Example:**
> *Innan de tar färjan, köper de glass i kiosken.*
> (Before the ferry → ice cream. Obviously. Priorities.)

> *Medan Brian arbetar, bakar Sara vaniljbullar.*
> *(While Brian works, Sara bakes vanilla buns. Brian works. Sara bakes. We all know who's winning.)*

## ⚡ Kontrastsubjunktjoner — "Yeah, but STILL…"

Two ways to say "even though" — but they're NOT the same. Sorry.

| Subjunktion | Use it when… | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **trots att** | It's a **fact**. It happened. It's real. | *De sitter ute och äter, trots att det är kallt i dag.* (It IS cold. They ARE sitting outside. Facts.) |
| **även om** | It's a **speculation**. Habits. Maybes. The future. | *De brukar sitta ute och äta, även om det är kallt.* (They USUALLY do this. It MIGHT be cold. Who knows.) |

**🧠 Quick hack:**
- **trots att** = "Despite the FACT that…"
- **även om** = "Even IF…"

## 🎯 för att — "Why though?"

**för att** = purpose / goal / the reason you're doing something

> *När de har fikat, går de ut i skogen **för att** plocka blåbär och kantareller.*
> *(After fika → forest → berries & chanterelles. The Swedish dream.)*
