## Relative Clauses: SOM vs DÄR
*or: How to sound Swedish while confusing yourself*

---

### **SOM** = The Overachiever

**SOM** wears many hats (like a true Swede at midsommar):

**Hat #1: Subject** 🎩
- *Det är ett hus **som** ligger vid vattnet.*
- (SOM is doing the work here—it's the subject!)

**Hat #2: Object** 👒
- *Det är ett ställe **som** jag älskar.*
- (SOM just introduces; "jag" does the work)

**Hat #3: Preposition Magnet** 🧲
- *Det är en person **som** jag är kär **i**.*
- (The preposition gets LONELY and moves to the END. Don't ask why. Sweden.)

### **DÄR** = The Location Specialist

**DÄR** only cares about PLACES (it's very focused):

- *Ett ställe **där** det finns kantareller.*
- ✅ Always use DÄR for locations
- ✅ Always put the subject AFTER där
- ❌ **NEVER** use "var" here (this isn't Spanish class!)

---

### Quick Memory Trick 🧠

- **SOM** = "who/that/which" (does everything)
- **DÄR** = "where" (only places, always chill in the back)

*Lycka till! And remember: if in doubt, just add "som"—you'll be right 60% of the time! 🎉*
