Swedish Definiteness Cheat Sheet 🇸🇪

The Four Golden Rules of Swedish Articles
1. 🆕 New Info = Indefinite Form
"A wild noun appears!"
New information for your listener/reader → indefinite form (singular with en/ett)
Example: "Jag såg en hund" (I saw a dog) - First mention? Use en/ett!

2. 🎯 Known Info = Definite Form
"We meet again, old friend..."
Information already known to your listener/reader → definite form
Example: "Hunden var stor" (The dog was big) - We know this dog now!

3. 👋 My, Your, His = Always Indefinite
"Possessives are greedy - they don't share the 'the'!"
After possessive pronouns (min, din, hans, etc.) and genitive → always indefinite form
Example: "min bil" (my car) - NOT "min bilen" ❌

4. 🔄 "Nästa" & "Samma" = Always Indefinite
"Next and same are lone wolves"
After nästa (next) and samma (same) → always indefinite form
Examples:

"nästa vecka" (next week)
"samma dag" (same day)


5. 👉 "Den/Det/De" (this/that/those) = Always Definite
"When you point, be specific!"
After demonstrative pronouns den här/där, det här/där, de här/där → always definite form
Example: "den här bilen" (this car) - Point + definite = Swedish style! ✨

Lycka till! (Good luck!) 🍀
